# First Quarter Reflections

## 1. List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well.
1. **Variables and Data Types**  
   I understand variables and data types very well because they are the foundation of programming.  We learned this in Grade 7 using Python, but I really understood it during Grade 8. Variables store information, and data types define the kind of value that can be stored (such as int, string, or boolean, etc). We declared variables and indentifiec the right data types for different situation so many times, which made me more confident with the topic.

2. **Basic Conditional Statements**  
   Conditional statements like `if`, `else if`, and `else` allow programs to make decisions. I learned how to structure them properly and use logical operators to test conditions. The exercises we did last year helped me alot.

 3. **Input and Output Statements**  
   I am confident in using input and output functions, such as `console.log` for displaying messages and `prompt` (or similar commands) for getting user input. These statements are important because they allow interaction between the user and the program. I practiced them often in class, which made it easier for me to learn it.

4. **Arithmetic and Logical Operators**  
   I know how to use operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, as well as logical operators like `&&`, `||`, and `!`. These operators are straightforward because they are similar to what Iâ€™ve already learned in math. Practicing them in different coding problems improved my speed and accuracy.

5. **Basic GitHub Knowledge**  
   I learned how to  create a respository, commit and into a GitHub repository.  I also learned how  make create a "server through GitHub". This was very useful because it showed me how programmers collaborate and track changes in projects.

## 2. List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but need further practice/discussion and why.
1. **Functions**  
   I can describe what functions are, but I still need practice in applying them to harder tasks. Sometimes I struggle with when to use parameters or how to return values properly.

2. **Arrays**  
   Arrays are clear in definition, but I need more practice in accessing elements, iterating over them, and understanding multidimensional arrays. I sometimes confuse the syntax when combining arrays with loops.

3. **Markdown Advanced Formatting**  
   While I know basic Markdown (like headers, lists, and bold/italic text), Im still  not confident with  tables, links,etc. These things are important for documentation, and I want to use them more effectively.

4. **Loop Structures**  
   I understand the basic concepts of it, but it can get really confusing for me at times.  I need more practice in doing these harder loop structures so I don't struggle in the future.

5. **Problem-Solving with Pseudocode**  
   I can describe pseudocode and its purpose, but I need more practice in writing it clearly. Sometimes I jump straight into code without planning, which causes errors or inefficient solutions.

## 3. Describe what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second item.
1. For functions, I will practice by creating small programs that use parameters and return values, such as a calculator program or a grade checker.  
2. For arrays, I will do more exercises on iterating through arrays and solving problems like finding the largest number, searching for specific elements, or sorting data.  
3. For Markdown advanced formatting, I will explore GitHub README files and other online documentation, then try to replicate their structure using tables, links, and images. I will also practice writing my own notes in Markdown until I become more confident.  
4. For loop structures, I will focus on more challenging exercises, like nested loops or loops combined with conditionals, until I become more comfortable.  
5. For pseudocode, I will make it a habit to outline my solution in plain English before writing actual code, and then compare my pseudocode with the final program to improve step by step.

## 4. In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think were not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why.
1. **Effective Activities**  
   - The coding exercises  were very effective. They gave me hands-on experience and helped me apply the lessons immediately.  
   - The examples you gave during class were actually really helpful, as it explained a lot of my questions about any topic

2. **Not Effective Activities**  
   - Long lectures without coding practice were less effective. Sometimes I understood the concept during class but forgot it quickly without exercises.  
   - The Kahoots in my opinion didnt really help me learn, as it was very competetive, and while it was fun, I didnt really absorb anything from it.
